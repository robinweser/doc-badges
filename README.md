# doc-badges

A collection of useful badges to be used for project and API documentation.

> Right now this is just a demo. There will be vector versions as well as multiple sizes.<br>I will also add static links to use the badges directly.

#### Comming soon
I will add a lot of badges soon such as type badges for most languages.<br>Feel free to request any other badge.

## Usage
Every badge can be served from the GitHub repository right now.<br>
Use the following link and just replace `%NAME%` with one of the names from above.

## Sizing
There are different recommendations how to size the badges depending on the usage.
* **GitHub & GitBook**:<br>To use these badges within GitHub or GitBook Markdown files I recommend using a height of `20px` as it perfectly fits the line height and font size in most cases. If you're using the badge for headings you might want to use up to a maximum of `25px`.

## Contributing
Are you missing a badge or want to improve the current badges somehow? Feel free to file an issue to discuss the changes.<br>
**Do not** just send a pull request as it might be rejected anyway.
